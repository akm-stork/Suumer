        <div class="it-p">The ancient walled city of Babylon rose to prominence during the reign of Hammurabi, the
          Mesopotamian king renowned for the world's first written law. From Babylon, which means Gate of the Gods, he
          ruled an empire that stretched across most of Mesopotamia. But it was under Nebuchadnezzar II, the second and
          greatest king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, that Babylon reached glory.</div>

          was the capital of the Old Assyrian kingdom. As such, Ashur did not originally have a family, but as the cult
          came under southern Mesopotamian influence, he later came to be regarded as the Assyrian equivalent of Enlil,
          the chief god of Nippur. Enlil was the most important god of the southern pantheon from the early 3rd
          millennium BC until Hammurabi founded an empire based in Babylon in the mid-18th century BC, after which
          Marduk replaced Enlil as the chief god in the south.</div>
